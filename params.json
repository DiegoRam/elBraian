{"name":"Elbraian","tagline":"Codebase for every POC on elBraian project","body":"elBraian\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis is my awesome proyect about robotics and programming applied to education matters.\r\n\r\nBasically is a RasbberryPi robot based which acts as its own Access Point providing connectivity for every known wifi device.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was my hobby for last past year, I’ve been learning a lot, even I improved my professionals skills and I think nowadays it’s my most valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the MotoDriver I built is a part of another open source project (by my own as well, [Educabot Repo](https://github.com/educabot/piMotoDriver) ) , here you can find the entire application to get your own Braian up&&running in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nI used  the NOOBS Linux Distribution from [Official RaspberryPi Site](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).\r\n\r\n### Access Point\r\nThe entire process was documented in [Hotspot.md](https://github.com/DiegoRam/elBraian/blob/master/doc/hotspot.md)\r\n\r\n### Video streaming\r\nPlease take a look at this documentation [videoResearch.md](https://github.com/DiegoRam/elBraian/blob/master/doc/videoResearch.md). The important thing did occur at June 2014, after many shots :D.\r\n\r\n### Keep Alive your application\r\n\r\nTo put al the things together and keep them alive I used [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) you might use anything you like. At [supervisor.md](https://github.com/DiegoRam/elBraian/blob/master/doc/supervisor.md) you will find how to configure Supervisor.\r\n\r\n### BraianServer\r\n\r\nThis is a web container which uses [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/latest/) as container and it provides us with a pretty neat and well documented interface.\r\n\r\nThe only you need is to clone this repository and start the whole thing with \r\n\r\n\t\t$sudo python app-braianbot.py \r\n\r\nor leave it to Supervisor handling.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
